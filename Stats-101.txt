Type of Data:

    - Qualitative 

        - Nominal: Named Variables, the order does not make any difference
        - Ordinal: This is orderly values if the order will change then the meaning will change

    - Quantitative

        - Continuous: Can take any number
        - Discrete: This has defined values but it should be numeric for eg. month number (1-12)
        - Interval: In any series interval is the difference between two values, if we have zero in this it should have a meaning like 0 temperature but not 0 weight, So it can not have an absolute zero
        - Ratio: This is a ratio between two or more values and this can have an absolute zero for ex. age: A is 15 years old B is 20 years old ratio is 3:4


1. Descriptive Statistics: 

    - Central Tendency
        - Mean
        - Median
        - Mode 
    
    - Measure of dispersion
        - Range
        - Variance 
        - Standard Deviation
        - Coefficient of variance : This is used to compare two dataset with two different units like (weight and height)

    - Sampling
        - Random Sampling
        - Stratified Sampling
        - Read different types of Sampling
        

    - Normal Distribution(Rule to satisfy Normal Distribution)
        - Mean, Median and Mode all are same (It should be μ)
        - 68% of data should be in Standard Deviation 1 (From μ-σ to μ+σ)
        - 95% of data should be in Standard Deviation 2 (From μ-2σ to μ+2σ)
        - 99.7% of data should be in Standard Deviation 3 (From μ-3σ to μ+3σ)

        Z-score = ( x - μ ) / σ

        x = 80 (any value), 
        μ = 25 (Mean)
        σ = 5 (Standard Deviation)
        
        ( 80 - 25 ) / 5 =  11 ( 11 is z-score )


        NOTE : Sampling is divided ny n-1 where n is a sample size, to bring the variance and Standard Deviation near to mean.


    - Measure of Shape (Skewness)

        - Positive Skew
        - Symmetric Distribution
        - Negative Skew 


2. Inferential Statistics: 

    - Corelation
        - Positive Corelation - When increase in one Variable increases the value of other Variable and vice versa. 
        - Negative Corelation - When increase in one Variable decreases the value of other Variable and vice versa.
        - No Corelation - When change in one Variable does not make any change in other Variable.

        Value of Corelation lies between -1 and +1

    - Covariance
        This will not tell you the degree of relationship this will give +ve and -ve value to check if it is Positively related or -ve for Negatively related.

Probability 

    - Random Variable
        - Discrete Random Variable - P(H) : Probability of getting head , P(T) : Probability of getting Tail
        - Continuous Random Variable - P(W<100) : Probability of having (W)eight less then 100

    - Additive Rule of Probability - Below is the rule for mutually inclusive event
        - P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
