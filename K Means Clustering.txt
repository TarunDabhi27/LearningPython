K Mean - 
    This is unsupervised algorithm, and we do not have target variable.

1. Choose the number of cluster needed say "n"
2. "n" random points will be selected in cluster, and these "n" points will be center of cluster
3. Distance between these "n" points and other points will be calculated and formed the Clusters.
4. Mean will be calculating for each Cluster and these points will be the center of the Clusters.
5. These all steps will be repeated until no cluster repositioning is happening. 

NOTE: If few columns are dominating  because of big number like salary, 
This type of columns will be standardized by some methods so it will reduce the value of salary, this processes called scaling.


- How to choose K value i.e. Number of Clusters?
    There are two methods of choosing K value
    1. Elbow Plot : 
        Graph will be plot X will range from 2 to 10 representing different value of K
        Y will represent the sum of intra-distance(distance between center and other points of cluster). 
        We will draw the graph and select the best point.
    
    2. Silhouette Score :
        This will give value from -1 to 1.
        When we get the value 1 as a result it means all the clusters are different.
        When the values are less then 1 it means the clusters are not proper.

        Formula : b - a / Max( b - a )

        a : Mean of intra-distance
        b : Mean of distance with the mean of nearest cluster
