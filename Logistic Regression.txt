Cost Function in Logistic Regression : 

odds = Probability / (1 - Probability)
if Probability is 2/5 then 
odds = 2/5 / (1 - 2/5)  = 2/3

odds Ration = ration of two odds


NOTE : Odds Ratio is the foundation of Logistic Regression.

- Sigmoid Function
- Logit Function: Used to link Probability with Independent Variable.
- Probit Function
