Linear Regression : 
    - Gradient Descent
        - Cost Function
    - Ordinary Least Square (OLS) Regression
    
    MSE - Mean Square of error and 
    RMSE - Square Root of MSE

    NOTE : Check the videos of Andrew Ng's Linear Regression.


    - Valid use case
    - Data Extraction 
    - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
        - Missing value treatment
            1. Replace the missing Numeric value with Mean/Median value.
            2. Replace the missing Categorical values with Mode value.
        - Outliers treatment
            - Capping - Setting the upper bound - 99 Percentile will be the Cap or Q3+(1.5 * IQR)
            - Flooring - Setting the lower bound - 1 Percentile will be the Floor or Q1-(1.5 * IQR)
        - Corelation
        - Plot different graphs for data Analysis
                - Uni-Variant Analysis
                - Bi-Variant Analysis

    NOTE : 
        1. Drop the Missing values when the percentage of missing values as compared to total number of records is less. This is the last option.
            We have other ways as well like treating the values by setting he mean or setting it to zero etc.

        2. We can convert the data into "logarithmic form" if we don't have the normal distribution in the data. 



    SciKit learn needs all the data in Numeric, so we have to convert the categorical values into numeric 
        for ex. for gender column : male and female will be 0 and 1
            male = 0
            female = 2
        There are two ways to do this as below: 
            - Label Encoding - This is not mostly used as different value give priority to values which is not good. 
            - One hot encoding or dummy encoding - This is mostly used method.
